selint
======

An R package to estimate the phenotypic integration index, the RV coeffcient of modularity and their jackknife pseudovalues. This allows testing biological hypotheses about the adaptive significance of different patterns of integration, using simple phenotypic selection approaches, as described in Benitez-Vieyra et al.
(in prep.). 
In addition, *selint* provides function to perform simulations and test the accuracy of these methods. These functions allow to build correlation matrices with a given integration or with modular structure.


##Installation

* install.packages('devtools')
