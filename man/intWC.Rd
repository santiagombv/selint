\title{Wagner-Cheverud phenotypic integration index}
\usage{
intWC(data, correct = TRUE, type = c("cor", "raw.data"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or matrix with two or more numeric variables}

\item{correct}{Whether or not to correct eigenvalue variance by sample size.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{type}{A character string indicating if the data is data frame or matrix
with raw data (\code{'raw.data'}) or a correlation matrix (\code{'cor'}).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to function \code{cor}}
}
\value{
the Wagner-Cheverud phenotypic integration index (INT).
}
\description{
intWC estimates the relative variance of the eigenvalues of a correlation
matrix, corrected by sample size.
}
\details{
The variance of the eigenvalues is estimated as a population
variance (i.e. over N instead of N-1), where N is the number
of traits. The variance of eigenvalues ranges from zero, when all
eigenvalues are equal, to a maximum of N-1, when only one
eigenvalue is larger than zero. To allow comparisons among samples
with different number of traits, the variance of eigenvalues is displayed
as a percentage of this maximum. When \code{correct = TRUE} (default) the
variance of eigenvalues is corrected by substracting the expected value of
eigenvalue variance for finite sample correlation matrices for uncorrelated
variables, i.e. (N-1)/M where N is the number of traits and M is
the sample size.
